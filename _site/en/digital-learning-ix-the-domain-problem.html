    <p>If you were choosing a restaurant to eat sushi:<br />
Which would you prefer?<br />
One that serves <strong>only sushi</strong>, or one that also offers pizza, burgers, and pasta?</p>

<p>If you place particular value on <strong>authentic sushi</strong>, you’d probably opt for the first.<br />
One could at least assume that it has a chef who specializes in preparing sushi.</p>

<p>A restaurant offering multiple cuisines, on the other hand, aims to appeal to as many tastes as possible.<br />
And unless there’s some kind of super-chef behind the scenes, the sushi likely won’t stand out among the other dishes.</p>

<p>The same idea applies to the development of educational software—and is known as the <strong>domain problem</strong>.<br />
A <em>domain</em> is, simply put, the <strong>specialized subject area</strong> an application is designed for.</p>

<p>In concrete terms, this means that while programmers are experts in their own domain (programming),<br />
they don’t necessarily have domain knowledge in the subject area they’re building software for—for example, language training.</p>

<p>Companies that want to develop and market such learning applications are therefore dependent on acquiring and implementing <strong>expert knowledge</strong>,<br />
which creates a <strong>tension between business goals and user needs</strong>.</p>

<p>The company wants to build and sell a product profitably.<br />
The user wants a cost-effective application tailored to their needs.</p>

<p>Now, imagine a company developing a language trainer for <strong>20 different languages</strong>.<br />
Their goal is to attract as many customers as possible—so it’s likely they cut corners on domain expertise.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t hold high expectations for an app meant equally for Chinese and English learners—<br />
just like you wouldn’t expect outstanding sushi at a restaurant that also serves burgers and pasta.</p>

<p>Languages can differ enormously.<br />
To meet the demands of serious language study, one must treat <strong>language training</strong> as its own domain,<br />
with <em>English language training</em> as one domain, <em>Chinese language training</em> as another, and so on.</p>

<p>As I noted earlier regarding books, <strong>quantity and quality are negatively correlated</strong>.<br />
The more general and wide-ranging an application is, the more diluted its individual parts tend to be.</p>

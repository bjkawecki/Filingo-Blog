<a class="link-external" href="https://de.babbel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Babbel{% include icons/external-link.html %}</a> was an early player in the digital language-learning segment. The Berlin-based company launched in 2007 with a Spanish course and now offers 14 languages. Annual revenue exceeds 200 million euros.

Babbel is often contrasted with Duolingo—as the more structured platform with a stronger focus on grammar and practical use. I wanted to see how that claim holds up for the Russian course.

Since I didn’t want to subscribe, I could only get a limited impression. The exercises included, among other things, text selection, matching text and images, and linking Cyrillic and Latin letters, limited to simple words like "кто" or "там".

There were also listening exercises with multiple-choice answers and tasks where you had to put letters or words in the right order. Content is organised into fixed learning paths and leads step by step through modules. When reviewing, you don’t type; you only indicate whether you knew a word or not.

## What speaks in favor of Babbel?

- Clear, fixed learning paths
- Low-threshold entry
- Short, self-contained practice units
- Wide range of languages in the subscription

## Where are the weaknesses?

- Little opportunity to try for free (minimum three-month subscription)
- Languages only available as a bundle
- Russian course only at A1 and A2 level
- Mostly closed exercise formats

## Conclusion

Babbel advertises that more than 150 language experts design courses so that learners can quickly have meaningful conversations. I couldn’t see that claim reflected in the Russian course. The approach seems geared to simple, heavily guided interaction.

The company’s commercial success is notable. Besides the product itself, its early position in the market may play a role. Podcasts and live lessons are also on offer. Based on the course material I tested, however, I find it hard to see what sets the offering apart.

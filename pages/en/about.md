# About the Filingo Blog

On this blog I gather my thoughts on digital learning, especially Russian, and on Filingo’s development – the successor to **Bajkal**, my first Russian learning web app. If you want to use Filingo or understand the ideas behind it, you’ll find the context here. Filingo is still in development. Updates are published here.

## About me

I have a degree in Russian studies and work as a web developer. In 2020 I started building a Russian learning web app. The trigger was my experience that language acquisition – especially for less widely spoken languages – often asks too much of learners. I believe there’s a need for relief through structured and efficient presentation of knowledge. I also believe that digital media in pedagogy are still underdeveloped and their potential remains to be explored.

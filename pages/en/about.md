# About the Filingo Blog

Filingo is the successor to Bajkal, my first Russian learning web app. On this blog I document my reflections on digital learning – with a focus on Russian – and on Filingo’s development.

If you want to use Filingo or understand the underlying concepts, you’ll find the context here. The project is currently in development; updates are published here on a regular basis.

## About me

My name is Björn Kawecki. I have a degree in Russian studies and work as a web developer. In 2020 I started developing a Russian learning web app. The starting point was my observation that less widely spoken languages often overwhelm learners in a structural way – less because of their complexity than because of how content is conveyed.

## Digital learning

I am convinced that the didactic potential of digital media is not yet fully realised. Learners – whether at school, university, or in self-study – need clearly structured content that reduces complexity and provides orientation. With this project I aim to contribute to that.
